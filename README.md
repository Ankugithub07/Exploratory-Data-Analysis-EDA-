Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Overview:

This project involves predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using a dataset from IBM Sample Data Sets. The goal is to analyze customer data and identify key factors that lead to churn, helping develop focused customer retention programs. This repository includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and steps toward building predictive models using machine learning techniques.

Dataset:

The dataset contains customer details such as demographic information, services signed up for, account information, and whether they have churned.

Churn: Whether the customer left the company within the last month.
Services: Phone service, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming services (TV and movies).
Account Info: Contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
Demographics: Gender, age range, marital status, and dependents.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process helps in understanding the dataset's structure, cleaning the data, and identifying important variables that impact customer churn. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary of features (mean, median, mode, etc.).
Visualizations: Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, bar plots, and boxplots to gain insights.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing columns for better model performance.
Key Insights
Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those with one or two-year contracts.
High monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates.
Customers using online security and tech support services tend to have lower churn rates.
Demographics such as senior citizens have a higher churn probability.

Future Work
Building a customer churn prediction model using algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Optimizing the model using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
Creating a dashboard for visualizing customer churn probabilities.
